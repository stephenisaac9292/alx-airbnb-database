# SQL Subqueries â€“ Airbnb Database

This file contains SQL subqueries for advanced practice:

1. **Non-correlated subquery**: Retrieve all properties where the average review rating is greater than 4.0.
2. **Correlated subquery**: Find users who have made more than 3 bookings.

Both queries use proper `ORDER BY` clauses to pass ALX project checks.
