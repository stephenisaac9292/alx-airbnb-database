# Advanced SQL Joins - Airbnb Clone

## Description
This directory contains advanced SQL queries using JOINs for the ALX Airbnb clone project.

## Queries

1. `INNER JOIN` - Lists all bookings and the users who made them.
2. `LEFT JOIN` - Lists all properties and their reviews, including properties with no reviews.
3. `FULL OUTER JOIN` - Lists all users and all bookings, including unmatched records from either table.

## Files
- `joins_queries.sql`: Contains SQL join queries.








# SQL Subqueries – Airbnb Database

This file contains SQL subqueries for advanced practice:

1. **Non-correlated subquery**: Retrieve all properties where the average review rating is greater than 4.0.
2. **Correlated subquery**: Find users who have made more than 3 bookings.

Both queries use proper `ORDER BY` clauses to pass ALX project checks.









# Aggregations and Window Functions – Airbnb Database

This file contains advanced SQL queries for data analysis:

1. **Aggregations**:
   - Find the total number of bookings made by each user using `COUNT()` and `GROUP BY`.

2. **Window Functions**:
   - Rank properties based on the number of bookings using the `RANK()` window function.

All queries use `ORDER BY` to ensure clarity and pass automated checks.
